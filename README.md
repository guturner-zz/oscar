Spring Boot app. A hub to view logs for IoT devices.

The mascot for this application is an octopus with tentacles reaching throughout a smart home. Each tentacle represents access to a specific smart device. Eventually, api.ai support will give our octopus intelligence.

* Web APIs (Ecobee, SmartThings, etc.)
* api.ai

# Setup
Certain files have been hidden from this repository. You will need to populate a info.properties and refresh_token.properties for each smart device under src/main/resources/iot
